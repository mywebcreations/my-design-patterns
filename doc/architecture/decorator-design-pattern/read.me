Here's how the program works:

An instance of the Computer class is created.
It is then wrapped in several decorators (HDD, SSD, SDCardReader, and OpticalDrive), each adding a specific feature to the Computer object.
When computer.add() is called, it goes through the decorator chain, and each decorator adds its own functionality to the result, resulting in the final string that combines all the added features.
In this example, the add method in each decorator appends its feature to the result obtained from the add method of the wrapped Computer object.

So, the program demonstrates how the Decorator pattern allows you to add and combine features dynamically while keeping the interface of the original object consistent.

does the program call the add method of each decorator implicitly?
ChatGPT
Yes, in the program you provided, the add method of each decorator is called implicitly when you invoke the add method on the Computer object that has been wrapped in multiple decorators.

Here's how it works step by step:

Initially, you create a Computer object.

Then, you wrap this Computer object in decorators one by one:

First, it becomes an HDD object with computer as its wrapped Computer.
Then, it becomes an SSD object with computer as its wrapped Computer.
Next, it becomes an SDCardReader object with computer as its wrapped Computer.
Finally, it becomes an OpticalDrive object with computer as its wrapped Computer.
When you call computer.add(), the method is executed on the outermost decorator (OpticalDrive), which calls computer.add() on the decorator it wraps (SDCardReader). This process continues down the chain of decorators until it reaches the innermost Computer object.

Each decorator appends its own feature to the result obtained from calling add on the wrapped Computer object.

So, the Decorator pattern allows you to add functionalities dynamically while preserving a consistent interface, and it does this by recursively calling the methods of each decorator in the chain.
